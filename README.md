# Shortest_Path_Genetic_Algorithm
## This is a genetic algorithm which calculates the shortest path between two points. 

The program is written in Processing a language based on Java. It uses a genetic approach to approximate the shortest distance between the starting point end the endpoint. 
I wrote the program in about 2 hours and was able to get pretty good results in such a short period of time.

Implemented are:
*	Mutation function
*	Crossover function
*	Fitness function with different determinations (linear, Gaussian, exponential)
*	Parents determination which are chosen probabilistic

It is not perfect but it is an easy starting point from which new function can be added.
